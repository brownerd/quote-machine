## Things to try later:
1. Previous feature
2. Archive feature
3. Better Error handling


## Notes:
- So, I hacked Tyler Moeller's pen to figure out the Twitter thing. I really liked how he got the Twitter window to open up. I also like [this approach](http://codepen.io/mpopv/pen/aNbqrq?editors=1010) too
- I also like How Tyler tested to make sure that the lenght of text from the api was also short enough to be tweeted. I'm not going to do it becuase I want to see all the quotes. But that would be a smart piece of code to include.
- I did something that crashed the browers. I'm not sure what it was, but new tabs started opening up every half second.
- I made an FCC logo that I'll be using on a few more pens
- I watched Kyle Simpson's tut on FrontEnd Masters for organizing the JS
- This pen is partially responsive, but not mobile formatted
- I like Joe Balsamo's error handling in his [pen](http://codepen.io/jbalsamo/pen/rVvWvx)
